There are 10 sections which are introduction, problem statements, project objectives, proposed solutions, project scopes, literature review, evolutionary prototyping Methodology, deliverables, system demonstration and conclusion.

Firstly, I am going to give some information of the background of the problem. The physical yearbook is heavy and bulky and it is inconvenient to bring along with people. Hence, Digital yearbook app can solve the problems of physical yearbook and it is more functional.

Digital yearbook is less expensive and faster to prepare than a printed one. People can get the yearbook contents from anywhere in the global due to digital technology. The margins, printing flaws, and grammatical errors are not needed to worry because it can be simple to fix through digital yearbook web application.

Next, I am going present about the problem statements. The first problem statement is physical yearbooks are not convenient. In this new era, people found that the physical yearbooks is not convenient to bring wherever they want. People hope that there is a digital yearbook web application to reduce the time on flipping the physical books page-by-page so they can find out some specific class.

The second problem statement is physical yearbooks having risks on ease to damage and lost. Digital yearbook web application can keep the yearbooks safer than the physical yearbooks. Physical yearbooks easy to being lost since people easy to forget where it put after a few years. It is also easy to be damage such as the yearbook fell into the water accidentally or faded after a long years.

Next the third problem statement is cannot update the physical yearbooks instantly once the yearbooks printed. Yearbook verbally and visually preserves contents and events. People can create and post events to the digital yearbook web application instantly and  people also can always be notified of the events updates through the web application.

Moreover, this project consists of 4 objectives. The first objective is to analyse project requirements and review existing digital yearbook web applications in good effort. Besides, the second objective is to develop the low fidelity prototype of the application. Furthermore, the following objective is to develop a web application with determined modules. The last objective of this project is to evaluate the functionality of the digital yearbook web application.

Based on this figure, this is the overview of proposed solution and it consist of web applications, server and database. The user can browse to the web application by key in the url. The browser will request the page of the web application from the server and the server will response the requested file from the browser and the browser will execute the file. This is the interaction between server and web application. The database will store the user data such as name, password, photo and et cetera from the server. Moreover, the database will fetch back the data from database to the server when server require the data.

Next, the project scopes covered in this project were displaying yearbook contents and events, create class, yearbook content and event, search and join class functions and favourite event and manage event.

Before implementation of this system, it is important to study the context of the problem, solution and development. Therefore, the literature review is conducted during the planning phase in this project. In total 4 areas of studies are investigate in the literature review which are existing similar web applications, user interface, progressive web application versus native application and development methodologies.

In existing similar web applications, the comparison of the features for allyearbooks web application and classmates web application has been conducted.  The account creation and login feature and profile settings feature are existing in the both web application.  Besides, the contents organization feature and design templates features are only existing in allyearbooks web application. Moreover, the search function feature, manage events feature and notification of events feature are only existing in classmates web application.

Next, the evolution prototyping methodology has been selected to use in this project. It start with the requirement gathering and proceed to the iterations that include design, build prototype, evaluate with users and refine prototype until the users satisfied with the prototype. After that, engineer will develop the product and conduct the testing such as usability test, user acceptance test and et cetera to ensure that the final product is well being developed. The reason why this methodology being selected is because this methodology can always fulfil the user’s requirements and getting the feedback from users such as new features added to extend and improve the design and development of this project. Moreover, This methodology can help to define and fix the errors or bugs early which reduce the risk of implementing the wrong system, and avoid uncertainty huge workloads if bugs found in very late time.

To develop this system, there are some development tools will be used. The programming languages used are php, sql and javascript. Beside that, the bootstrap and Laravel are the frameworks will be use. Moreover, the database use in this project is mysql.

For the use case diagram, there are 2 actors which are admin and user. Moreover, there are 15 use cases in the use case diagram for this project.

The system architecture design of the project is using MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. In the MVC architecture, developing different view components for your model component is easily achievable. It empowers you to develop different view components, thus limiting code duplication as it separates data and business logic. The MVC platform hugely supports the development of web applications

Next, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a sort of structural diagram used in database architecture. As ERD are usually used for developing relational databases in terms of idea visualisation and physical database architecture, they may also be used in other contexts.

Moreover, An illustration of the movement of data within a system is called a data flow diagram (DFD). It demonstrates the entry and output of data into and out of the system. In addition, it displays the system's information sources, storage and destinations

Next, the implementation of this project were included routes, error handling and good practices. The routes were direct every of the application’s inquiries to the proper controller using Laravel routing feature. For error handling part, the main controller class makes use of the ValidatesRequests attribute, which offers a simple way to validate incoming HTTP requests using a choice of strong validation rules in this project. Moreover,  understandable code, code simplicity and readable code were the good practices implemented in this project.

For the testing part, unit testing, integration testing, usability testing and user acceptance testing were conducted in this project. There are 32 unit test cases and 39 integration test cases were passed which mean there are no bugs in this project. Usability test was conducted with 5 testers and the result score is 88 out of 100 which mean the usability of this project is excellent quality. Moreover, the user acceptance testing were conducted with 5 testers too. All the functional requirements are fulfilled.

Here is some sample screenshots of digital yearbook web applications

In conclusion, the project objectives were achieved successfully.  However, there are still  chance for improvement for this project for developers who interested to enhance it in future. Realtime notification enhancement, design options provision, add friends and forum feature provision and history list provision are the recommendations to improve this project make this project more functionality and usability.
